/// Like [`tree()`](crate::tree()), but it takes only two commits, `our_commit` and `their_commit` to automatically
/// compute the merge-bases among them.
/// If there are multiple merge bases, these will be auto-merged into one, recursively, if
/// [`allow_missing_merge_base`](Options::allow_missing_merge_base) is `true`.
///
/// `labels` are names where [`current`](crate::blob::builtin_driver::text::Labels::current) is a name for `our_commit`
/// and [`other`](crate::blob::builtin_driver::text::Labels::other) is a name for `their_commit`.
/// If [`ancestor`](crate::blob::builtin_driver::text::Labels::ancestor) is unset, it will be set by us based on the
/// merge-bases of `our_commit` and `their_commit`.
///
/// The `graph` is used to find the merge-base between `our_commit` and `their_commit`, and can also act as cache
/// to speed up subsequent merge-base queries.
///
/// Use `abbreviate_hash(id)` to shorten the given `id` according to standard git shortening rules. It's used in case
/// the ancestor-label isn't explicitly set so that the merge base label becomes the shortened `id`.
/// Note that it's a dyn closure only to make it possible to recursively call this function in case of multiple merge-bases.
///
/// `write_object` is used only if it's allowed to merge multiple merge-bases into one, and if there
/// are multiple merge bases, and to write merged buffers as blobs.
///
/// ### Performance
///
/// Note that `objects` *should* have an object cache to greatly accelerate tree-retrieval.
///
/// ### Notes
///
/// When merging merge-bases recursively, the options are adjusted automatically to act like Git, i.e. merge binary
/// blobs and resolve with *ours*, while resorting to using the base/ancestor in case of unresolvable conflicts.
///
/// ### Deviation
///
/// * It's known that certain conflicts around symbolic links can be auto-resolved. We don't have an option for this
///   at all, yet, primarily as Git seems to not implement the *ours*/*theirs* choice in other places even though it
///   reasonably could. So we leave it to the caller to continue processing the returned tree at will.
